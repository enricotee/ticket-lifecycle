</p>
<p>
You should be able to see the ticket you created. If an error is encountered, try using a different agent account. If the error still persists, you may need to readjust the access/permissions for your agent profiles.

Here, you'd want to make sure the ticket settings are proper and that it makes sense for the technician it's assigned to.

Upgrade the priority level from Normal to High/Emergency since the issue is a business impacting event.

Here, you can choose which agent to assign the ticket to. In real life, you would want to base this off of the Agent's position/skill level.

For this issue, you'd want to choose the highest severity (Sev-A) so that the ticket gets resolved as soon as possible.

<p>
Here, you'd want to transfer the ticket to a capable department like System Administrators due to the nature of their job description.

For practice purposes, say you actually coordinated with a System Engineer to find the solution. You would want to verify that the website is back up online and then annotate the solution in the reply comments to close the ticket out.
